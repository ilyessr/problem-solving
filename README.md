## Overview

In this repository, you'll find solutions to coding challenges across different domains, including algorithms, data structures, problem-solving, and more. These challenges are sourced from various platforms such as HackerRank, LeetCode, and others.

## Installation

To run the solutions locally, clone this repository to your local machine and ensure you have Node.js installed for TypeScript solutions, and JDK (Java Development Kit) for Java solutions. Then navigate to the appropriate directory and run the solution file using the corresponding interpreter.

### TypeScript Solutions

For TypeScript solutions, navigate to the `typescript` directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ilyessr/problem-solving.git
cd problem-solving/typescript
node counting_valley.js
```

### Java Solutions

For Java solutions, navigate to the `java` directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ilyessr/problem-solving.git
cd problem-solving/java
javac AngryProfessor.java
java AngryProfessor
```

Replace counting_valley.js and AngryProfessor.java with the names of the specific solution files you want to run.
